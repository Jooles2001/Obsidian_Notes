**Body:**
Good afternoon  Pr. %RESEARCHER_NAME,

My name is Jules Soria, I am a PhD student at Paris-Saclay University, working at the French Atomic Energy Commission, on the subject of "Trustworthiness of artificial intelligence". During the beginning of my thesis, I have done preliminary work on bridging the gap between Formal XAI methods and Concept-Based Models (CBM), while also researching ways to detect adversarial samples using Feature Attribution methods. 
_(I have absolutely no idea whether this information is **relevant** to my candidacy application)_

--- Echizen
As a Paris-Saclay University PhD student, I am eligible to participate in the NII Internship Program, and I am interested the following research topic "Generation and detection of adversarial examples". I am especially intIf you are keen on taking me as a NII intern, I would be delighted to discuss further with you possible refined topics, and how I could help join one of your research projects.

--- Ishikawa
As a Paris-Saclay University PhD student, I am eligible to participate in the NII Internship Program, and I am interested the following research topics you provided: "Generative AI for Trustworthy Software
Engineering" and "Search-based Repair for Deep Learning-based Systems".

--- Both

I remain at your disposal to discuss, (_along with my PhD supervisors?_),
