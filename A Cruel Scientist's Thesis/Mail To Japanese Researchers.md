**Body:**
Good afternoon  Pr. %RESEARCHER_NAME,

My name is Jules Soria, I am a PhD student at Paris-Saclay University, working at the French Atomic Energy Commission, on the subject of "Trustworthiness of artificial intelligence". During the beginning of my thesis, I have done preliminary work on bridging the gap between Formal XAI methods and Concept-Based Models (CBM), while also researching ways to detect adversarial samples using Feature Attribution methods. 
_(I have absolutely no idea whether this information is relevant to my candidacy application)_
