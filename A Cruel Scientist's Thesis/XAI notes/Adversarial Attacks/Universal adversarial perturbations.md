Image-agnostic _quasi-imperceptible_ perturbation
* algorithm to find such universal perturbations
* high generalization property (trained on few classes, fools many untrained classes)
* generalize well across deep neural networks -> doubly universal
* high vulnerability of deep neural networks to universal perturbations through the geometric correlation between different parts of the decision boundary.
