Contributions
1. novel optimization framework that combines non-convex regularization with Nesterov's accelerated gradient descent to create adversarial attacks that are group-wise sparse.
   -> increase the likelihood of perturbing pixels that are close to the already perturbed pixels
2. experiments on CIFAR10 and ImageNet/NIPS2017
3. analysis between perturbations and salient image regions -> attacks as interpretable explanations
