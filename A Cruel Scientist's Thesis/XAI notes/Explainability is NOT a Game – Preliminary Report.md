# Key remarks
For a given data-result distribution, the Shapley values for an irrelevant feature might be nonzero

- Formula for relevancy
- Example with 4 binary features and 1 binary target
	- Feature 1 is irrelevant for the prediction yet has a higher Shapley value than the three other features
- Table of possible issues provided
