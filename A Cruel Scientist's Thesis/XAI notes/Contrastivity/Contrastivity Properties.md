From  [[From Anecdotal Evidence to Quantitative Evaluation Methods - A systematic Review]]
## Target Sensitivity
Captures “the intuition that class-specific features highlighted by
an explanation should differ between classes”
- So far only evaluated on heat-maps
- Some attribution methods can converge to class-insensitive explanations
- Visual inspections favor plausible heatmaps
	- high similarity between edge detectors for image data and explanatory saliency maps
-> A different prediction should then also lead to a different explanation
