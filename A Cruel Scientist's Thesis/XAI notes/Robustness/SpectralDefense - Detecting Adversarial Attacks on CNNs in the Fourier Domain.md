### Key Idea
- Use Fourier Magnitude and Phase of the image to detect whether it is perturbed
- Use " " " on the Layers of the CNN classifier model to detect whether the image is perturbed
- Train a LogisticRegression model on these features on these datasets
- Multiple types of attacks tested
- Multiple datasets tested (CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100)
- As $\epsilon$ increases, the attacks become successful (go from a correct prediction to a wrong one), but they also become more perceptible

For me:
-> similarly try to extract information, not just from the image, but from meta-information that is generated by the classifier as it processes the images for a prediction
-> use XAI attribution methods rather than
