### Introduction
- identify semantically meaningful components while only having access to image-level class labels not relying on additional part annotations
+ when no relevant prototypes are present in the image, with _e.g._ out-of-distribution data, PIP-Net will abstain from a decision.
- there exists a semantic gap between the similarity at image-level and latent representation
-> adversarial images for example
