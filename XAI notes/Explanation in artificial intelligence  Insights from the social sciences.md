### Major Findings
1. Explanations are contrastive - why did event P happen _instead of_ a certain event Q ?
2. Explanations are selected - a few causes is better than many (or even infinite) number of cause of a particular event
3. Probabilities should be avoided - the most *likely* explanation is not always the *best* explanation for a person. Using statistical generalisations to explain why events occur is satisfying if accompanied by an underlying causal explanation for the generalisation.
4. Explanations are social - they are a transfer of knowledge

--> explanations are not just the presentation of associations and causes (causal attribution), they are contextual.


Different definitions of causality:
- Counterfactual: C causes E if, hypothetically, C did not happen, then E would not have occurred either
- Interventionist: C causes E if, and only if, any changes to E can be brought by intervening on C
- Transference: if E is an event representing the change of energy of an object O, then C causes E if object O is in contact with the object that causes C, and there is some quantity of energy transferred.

Aductive Reasoning:
	D is a collection of data (facts, observations, givens).  
	H explains D (would, if true, explain D).  
	No other hypothesis can explain D as well as H does.  
	Therefore, H is probably true.
--> Inference to the best explanation !


Lambrozo and Wilkenfeld show that engaging in explanation but failing to arrive at a correct explanation can improve one’s understanding. They describe this as “explaining for the best inference”, as opposed to the typical model of explanation as “inference to the best explanation”.
